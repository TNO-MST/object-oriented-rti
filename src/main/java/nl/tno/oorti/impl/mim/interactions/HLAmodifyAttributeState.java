/**
 * Modify the ownership state of an attribute of an object instance for the specified joined
 * federate. If the interaction is used to give ownership of the instance attribute to the specified
 * joined federate and another joined federate currently owns the instance attribute, the owning
 * joined federate shall be divested of ownership of the instance attribute before ownership is
 * granted to the specified joined federate. No notification of change of ownership of the instance
 * attribute shall be provided to either joined federate. In order for ownership of the instance
 * attribute to be granted to the specified joined federate, the following conditions shall be true:
 * - The specified joined federate knows about the object instance. - The specified joined federate
 * is publishing the corresponding class attribute at the known class of the specified object
 * instance at that joined federate. - The specified instance attribute is not owned by the RTI
 * (i.e., it is not a predefined attribute of a MOM object class). If one or more of the above
 * conditions are not met, then the interaction shall have no effect and an error shall be reported
 * via an interaction of class HLAmanager. HLAfederate.HLAreport. HLAreportMOMexception.
